                <strong> Small Print - That Isn't Small</strong></p><p>Terms &amp; Conditions
</p><p>Please consult our terms and conditions below.
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Words and Phrases
</p><p>In these conditions:
</p><p>
</p><p>"Services" means the engineering and associated services relating to the Customer's Equipment as set out in the proposal specified in our quotation or other agreed documents or discussions between us.
</p><p>
</p><p>"We", "us" and "our" mean Bee Telecom providing Services to you.
</p><p>
</p><p>"You" and "your" mean the person or company to which we are providing Services.
</p><p>
</p><p>"Customer's Equipment" means the equipment or material belonging to you, or for which you request us to provide services.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Incorporation of Conditions
</p><p>a) Any contract or agreement to do work made between you and us shall be subject to these conditions, and any terms you put forward do not apply.
</p><p>
</p><p>b) All other terms and conditions which might be implied by conduct or a previous course of dealing or trade custom are excluded from this contract.
</p><p>
</p><p>c) No amendment or change shall be made to these conditions
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Quotations/Prices
</p><p>a) Our quotation provides an indication to you of the items on which you may place an order, but no order from you as a result of a quotation (or otherwise) shall be binding upon us unless and until it is accepted or confirmed by us.
</p><p>
</p><p>b) A quotation is made on the assumption that the work requested is reasonably capable of being carried out. If on inspection this is found in our opinion not to be the case, we will advise you to this effect as soon as reasonably practicable, and may offer you a reconditioned or new substitute on terms to be agreed. If you give a general instruction for repairs without specifying the particular service or replacement parts, we will be entitled to carry out such repairs or, modifications or service as in our opinion are necessary to put the Customer's Equipment in good working order, and to make an appropriate charge for the work and parts provided.
</p><p>
</p><p>c) Provided your order is placed within sixty days of the date of the quotation, the price contained on the quotation shall be fixed unless the quotation states otherwise. If your order is not placed in that period, then if any change shall occur after that in the costs of any materials, labour, transport or other items, including overheads, which we have to pay or incur for the performance of the Contract, then you will pay the resultant price.
</p><p>
</p><p>d) If delivery and performance are postponed at your request or by circumstance within your control you will pay all resulting costs and expenses we incur.
</p><p>
</p><p>e) We will charge for all work carried out at your request, whether exploratory or otherwise and, in particular, we reserve the right to instruct out employees or agents to work overtime to comply with your delivery requirements in which case we may charge you the cost of such overtime.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Work on Site
</p><p>If the Services are to be carried out on your premises or at your request at some other site we will need free and safe access to the customer's Equipment, together with proper and safe storage and protection of all goods, tools, plant and equipment and materials we have on site. We may also require additional facilities to carry out the Services such as electricity. You will observe and comply with the latest Health and Safety at Work Legislation and ensure that the site is safe and without risk to the health and safety of all persons working there; and you will hold us harmless against all legal and regulatory proceedings, costs and charges in respect of your failure to do so.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Payment
</p><p>Unless otherwise agreed with you by us, we will issue an invoice for the full amount due on completion of the Services. &nbsp;All payments will be in pounds Sterling.
</p><p>
</p><p>6. Designs Drawings and Specifications
</p><p>You shall be responsible for the accuracy of any designs, specifications and other data, which you or your employees or agents supply to us, which we use in connection with the Services, even if we examine, inspect or comment upon them. You will hold us harmless against any liability to a third party which we may incur as a result of carrying out the Services in accordance with your instructions or your designs, drawings, specifications or other data.
</p><p>
</p><p>7. Warranty
</p><p>a) We will take reasonable care of the Customer's Equipment whilst it is in our custody and make good any loss damage caused by our failure to exercise reasonable care, our liability being limited to the replacement value of the Equipment.
</p><p>
</p><p>b) We also undertake to use reasonable skill and care in carrying out the work and to use materials, which are suitable quality and free from defects.
</p><p>
</p><p>c) Unless otherwise agreed, we will rectify defective work and /or defective materials notified to us in writing within 24 months of the completion of the work and liability for defective work and/ or defective materials is limited to the invoice value thereof. We will have no responsibility for other loss or damage, including (without limitation) loss profit or production, except as required by law.
</p><p>
</p><p>d) Unless we have agreed to do so, you will accept full responsibility for re-installing, examining and testing the Equipment on which we have worked as soon as it is completed and we shall not be responsible for any damage, cost or loss incurred by you due to your failure to properly re-install or delay in testing the equipment or in notifying us of any defect in the work.
</p><p>
</p><p>8. Transportation
</p><p>i) If we have agreed to transport the Equipment, in the event of loss or damage to Equipment in transit from any cause whatsoever our liability shall be limited at our option to replacing the Equipment or passing on the benefit of insurance. In no circumstances shall we be liable for other loss including (without limitation) loss of production or loss of profit or contracts.
</p><p>
</p><p>ii) We shall not be liable for any such transit damage unless we and the carriers are notified of such damage or loss within seven days of delivery. It is your responsibility to examine the goods immediately on receipt.

</p><p>
</p><p>The limitations and exclusions in these conditions reflect the value of this Contract to us and are considered to be reasonable. If you require us to accept greater liability we may be prepared to do so subject to agreement of an additional charge to reflect the increased risk and cost of insurance to us.
</p><p>
</p><p>11. Force Majeure
</p><p>We will not be liable to you for any failure to perform our obligations under this Agreement where that failure results from any cause outside our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural occurrences, disruption of power supplies, the action of third parties or industrial action.
